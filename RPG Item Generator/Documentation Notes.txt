* Property Definition
	* SetStaticValue and StaticValue only apply to properties with IsValueRanged set to false. If IsValueRanged is set to true, SetStaticValue 
	  and StaticValue will be ignored. 


* Item Definition
	* IsConsumable is used for items expected as consumable items. Examples... Gold, Health Refills, Mana Refills, Gems. MinimumDropLevel and MaximumDropLevel
	  still apply for these items. If you want these items to drop through the lifecycle of the game, set the MinimumDropLevel to 1 and set IgnoreMaximumDropLevel
	  to True. This is not intended for durability, durability should be passed in as a property definition currently if you require it.


* Initialization


* Initialization Validation
	* Soft failures (Warnings)
		Will still generate an item even if warnings are present. Will have a Passed value of true.
	* Hard failures (Erros)
		Will not generate an item with an error count greater than 0. Will have a Passed value of false.
	*Consumable Items
		Will validate if it has Explicit Properties. They are not intended to have Explicit Properties, as such Explicit Properties will be ignored during item generation.


* Returned Item Object
	* It's recommended to map this to your own object once you receive the generated item.
