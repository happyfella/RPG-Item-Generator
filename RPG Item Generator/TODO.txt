Pending:
	Setup a system to not drop the same type of item one after another
	Dynamic Naming based on properties
	Sockets based on rarity


Working:
	Create a tool that will take in a txt file and generate the ItemDefinitions, PropertyDefinitions, RarityDefinitions for the config process.
	Unique items, with a flag. If Unique, all properties in the item definition will populate on the item, the values will generate though
	Allow for re-initialization


Future:
	Add functionality to receive JSON and XML files for configuration.


Complete:
	Add execution path for consumable items
	Move any math calcs to it's own service
	Generate Item based on passed in TypeId
	Generate Item based on passed in CategoryId
	Figure out why rarity min property amount isn't working correctly, can have less than the minimum
	Generated item property count should take the rarity into account, this will go along with the minimum and maximum explicit properties
	Find a better model name for ConfidValidation
	Add summary comments to models
	Add Value calculation to Calculation Service
	Use static value from property definition in calculations for both consumable and non-consumable items. 
		static value cannot be used for ranged value properties
	Add validation for id that are passed in with ItemDefinition but aren't in rarityDefinition or PropertyDefinition
	If ItemDefinition.Rarities has a count of 0, will default to highest propbable change rarity.
	Handle what happends when a no rarities are specified in the Item Definition. Do I even want that to be possible, what about consumable items
	Ignore Explicit properties for consumables
	Instead of returning a new item if generation failed, maybe have a list of errors on the Item object that is returned
	Add validation for null checks on all properties within all definitions. No value should be null (modified)
	Add sockets to items
	Defensive code in all that is received from the client, handle the issues
	Make it so the item level is generated close to the level passed in to the item generator, need to handle through configuration in item definition
		Needs a range value and flag
	Handle what happens if all Rarity drop thresholds are equal but add up to 1.... 0.50 and 0.50... 4 * 0.25...
	Item level should work with generated property value, higher level should have a slightly higher property value without exceeding the max value
		ValueScale should be used for this purpose.
