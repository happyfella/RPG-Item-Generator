Working:
	Make it so the item level is generated close to the level passed in to the item generator, need to handle through configuration in item definition
		Needs a range value and flag
	Item level should work with generated property value, higher level should have a slightly higher property value without exceeding the max value
	Defensive code in all that is received from the client, handle the issues
	Dynamic Naming based on properties
	Add summary comments to models
	Add Value calculation to Calculation Service
	Use static value from property definition in calculations for both consumable and non-consumable items. 
	Add sockets to items
	Setup a system to not drop the same type of item one after another
	Instead of returning a new item if generation failed, maybe have a list of errors on the Item object that is returned
	Handle what happends when a no rarities are specified in the Item Definition. Do I even want that to be possible, what about consumable items
	Ignore Explicit properties for consumables


Future:
	Add functionality to receive JSON and XML files for configuration.


Complete:
	Add execution path for consumable items
	Move any math calcs to it's own service
	Generate Item based on passed in TypeId
	Generate Item based on passed in CategoryId
	Figure out why rarity min property amount isn't working correctly, can have less than the minimum
	Generated item property count should take the rarity into account, this will go along with the minimum and maximum explicit properties
