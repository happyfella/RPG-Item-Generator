# Happy's RPG Item Generator
Simple, universal and configurable RPG item generator. 

### Documentation
I'm currently working on the documentation within the Wiki tab. If you see issues with the documentation or any confusion, please email me so I can make the necessary modifications.

See this [demo](https://github.com/happyfella/RPG-Item-Generator/wiki/Demo) on how to interact with the Item Generator. This demo shows an example of full configuration of all definitions, passing validation, generating items from all available endpoints, and printing them to a console. If you want, copy the demo into a console application so you can play with the Item Generator that is already configured.

### Other Information
If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback, feel free to email me at adambennettaz@gmail.com.
